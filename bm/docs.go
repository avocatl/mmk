// Package bm contains the go bindings for MMK's booking manager REST API.
//
// Booking Manager API is a standard Web service that enables clients
// to connect their data with external systems and services and to extend
// the automation benefits of the Booking Manager System.
//
// It is used by charter agencies to publish availabilities of Charter Operators
// and automate booking processes by connecting Booking Manager to their own web sites
// to allow for seamless online booking experience for end users or integrating it with
// their CRM solutions in order to automate office procedures.
//
// Charter operators use the web service to connect Booking Manager with their book keeping
// softwares and save time and effort in accounting department.
//
// Third Party Software tools also use Booking Manager API to display richer information,
// for example boat tracking systems are able to visualise client contact information directly on
// the map showing the boat location in real time.
